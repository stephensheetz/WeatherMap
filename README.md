# Weather App

## Requirements

 * Using Kotlin or Java, build an app that displays a Mapbox Map. 
   * See Mapbox instructions in References section of this README

 * When the user taps on the map, use OpenWeatherMap <https://openweathermap.org/> to get the multi-day forecast for the nearest city (reverse geocode).
   * See OpenWeatherMap instructions in References section of this README

 * Display weather data (day, description, icon, wind direction, wind speed) for tapped location to user using RecyclerView

 * Use an appropriate local persistence solution to save the weather data on device. Load weather data from the network only once for each location. Once the data has been recieved, it should be retrieved from the database.
   
 * Build a UI that allows the user to toggle between all locations that have saved weather data.
